on which I have to perform binary search to find the index of the range in which the number lies. For example:

Given the number -> 19 (It lies between index 0 and 1), return 0
Given the number -> 22 (It lies between index 1 and 2), return 1
Given the number -> 40 (It lies between index 3 and 4), return 3
